# Bits Utility

This library, in the namespace `gdr::bits`, is a collection of simple basic functions that I often use in my programming.  I am putting them here in the hope that they are useful to the C++ community.  I wish they were part of the standard library offerings in the bit manipulation space.

The library deliberately uses modules and other contemporary C++ constructs such as concepts.  In particular, it does not aim to bend backwards to support previous versions of C++.

Use as you see fit.
